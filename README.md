# Arc-Boost-Threads-Script
Threads will periodically set your feed to the "for you" feed as engagement bait. The different feeds do not have seperate URLs to make it particularly difficult to choose your own default with a bookmark. This code will check if you have been automattically returned to the "for you" feed and return you to following as the default.

## How to use with ARC browser boost
Navigate to Threads in your Arc Browser
```https://www.threads.net/```

Create a new boost (or add to your existing one)

Select the code option and move to the 'JS' Tab.

Paste the code in the snippet.js file.

Refresh the page.

Enjoy!
